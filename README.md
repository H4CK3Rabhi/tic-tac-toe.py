# tic-tac-toe.py
Python's Console Implementation of tic-tac-toe game

# Simple but moldable Representation
it is a standalone game  but i actually implemented it for training and making my Deep Learning based Learning Player.
so it will not be difficult to use  it with any ML or DL Algorithm.if you want to make something of that sort it otherwise it is a simple game
